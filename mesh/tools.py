def createGridOnThisSquare(square,tablename,n_partitions_in_x):
    """
    .. createGridOnThisSquare
    
    This function creates a GRID in the database.
    It makes use of the function: generategridon(polygon,t_name_grid_division)
    defined in the database. 
    It you need to install this functions the scripts are in biospatial/SQL_functions
    
    .. note:: This function needs a SQUARE polygon given as parameter if this requirement is not
    satisfied the grid will not be regular or may have problems to be defined.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
        square : Geometry WKT
            This object should be a square.
            
        tablename : String
            The grid name that is going to have the newly created table.
            
        n_partitions_in_x : integer
            The number of partitionsper axis the grid is going to have with respect to the square parameter.
            For example: if n_partitions_in_x = 2 then the grid will have 4 squares, 
            therefore 2 partitions in the x axis and 2 partitions in the y axis.

def createRegionalNestedGrid(parent_square,store_prefix,n_levels):
    """
    .. createRegionalNestedGrid
    This function creates the all the grids needed for analyzing a regions 
    with the Nestedtaxonomy module.
    The function uses the parent_square as parameter to define the square region in which it's going to 
    start the partion. The following levels are derived by partioning the former level by half in the X axis and half in the Y-axis
    giving four squares in the immediate successor. Therefore, each level is going to have 4 more cells than the previous level. 
    Giving a total number of 4^n cells, where n is the number of levels.
    This structure is the same as the canonical Quad-tree representation. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
        parent_square : geometry
            The square geometric object in WKT. Should be a square.
            
        store_prefix : string
            The prefix name that the grids are going to have. Could be,
            for instance, the name of the main region. e.g. mex
            
        n_levels : integer
            The number of levels (partitions) to build.
            
    .. note:: As it can be seen, the computational complexity of this 
    function is exponential, meaning that a high number of levels will lead in a
    high performance process that could crash the server or the postgres instance.
    Be careful with the number of levels to generate.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    Returns
    -------
    
        scales : dictionary
        The dictionary of the tables builded. For use with the mesh models. module
        
        e.g.
            scales = { 8 : 'mesh\".\"braz_grid8a',
              9 : 'mesh\".\"braz_grid16a',
